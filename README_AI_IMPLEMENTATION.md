## 🎯 Your Test Scenario

**Market-predictor container completely removed**

The AI will:
1. 🔍 **Analyze** the missing container situation  
2. 🧠 **Understand** this requires recreation, not restart
3. 📋 **Plan** appropriate Docker Compose recreation steps
4. ⚡ **Execute** the plan with continuous validation
5. ✅ **Ensure** service is fully operational
6. 📚 **Learn** from the experience for future scenarios

## 🔧 Deployment Requirements

```

### Quick Setup
```bash
# 1. Create new virtual environment (if needed)
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt  # or manual pip install above

# 3. Configure environment
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
