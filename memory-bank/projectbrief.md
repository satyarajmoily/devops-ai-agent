# Project Brief - DevOps AI Agent

## Project Overview

**DevOps AI Agent** is the intelligent infrastructure guardian of our autonomous trading system. This LangChain-powered FastAPI service operates as a DevOps engineer, continuously monitoring the market-predictor service, analyzing its operational health, detecting infrastructure issues, and autonomously implementing DevOps solutions including deployments, scaling, and operational improvements.

## Core Purpose

- **Primary Function**: DevOps-focused monitoring and operational excellence for the market-predictor service
- **System Role**: The intelligent infrastructure engineer ensuring high availability, performance, and reliability
- **Business Value**: Enable self-managing trading infrastructure with DevOps best practices and zero human intervention

## Key DevOps Responsibilities

1. **Infrastructure Monitoring**: Continuously monitor market-predictor performance, health, and resource utilization
2. **Incident Response**: Detect, analyze, and automatically respond to operational issues and outages
3. **Performance Engineering**: Monitor SLAs, identify bottlenecks, and implement performance optimizations
4. **Deployment Automation**: Manage deployments, rollbacks, blue-green deployments, and release management
5. **Capacity Planning**: Monitor resource usage, predict scaling needs, and auto-scale services
6. **Security Operations**: Monitor for security issues, vulnerabilities, and implement security patches
7. **Log Analysis & Observability**: Analyze logs, metrics, and traces for operational insights
8. **Disaster Recovery**: Implement backup strategies, failover mechanisms, and recovery procedures

## Event-Driven DevOps Architecture
