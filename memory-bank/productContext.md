### Core DevOps Workflows

#### Infrastructure Monitoring Loop:
```
1. Agent continuously monitors market-predictor infrastructure metrics
2. Collects performance data from Prometheus and operational logs from Loki
3. Analyzes resource utilization, response times, and error rates
4. Identifies trends, anomalies, and potential capacity issues
5. Triggers appropriate operational response workflows
```

#### Incident Response and Auto-Healing:
```
1. Infrastructure issue detected (high latency, errors, resource exhaustion)
2. Agent analyzes root cause using operational intelligence
3. Determines appropriate remediation strategy (restart, scale, failover)
4. Executes automated remediation with safety checks
5. Monitors resolution effectiveness and learns from outcome
6. Documents incident and response for future optimization
```

#### Deployment Automation:
```
1. Agent detects new deployment requirements or triggered deployments
2. Validates deployment readiness and infrastructure capacity
3. Executes deployment strategy (blue-green, canary, rolling)
4. Monitors deployment health and performance metrics
5. Automatically rolls back if issues are detected
6. Confirms successful deployment and updates operational status
```

#### Capacity and Performance Management:
```
1. Agent analyzes traffic patterns and resource utilization trends
2. Predicts future capacity requirements based on historical data
3. Implements auto-scaling decisions or resource adjustments
4. Optimizes performance through configuration tuning
5. Monitors impact of changes and adjusts strategies
6. Reports on capacity planning and performance improvements
