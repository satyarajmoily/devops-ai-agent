- **RESULT**: Agent now waits for real alerts and responds intelligently to actual issues

### How It Works Now:
1. **Prometheus** monitors Market Predictor via `/metrics` endpoint
2. **Alert Rules** detect real issues (service down, high response time, errors)
3. **Alertmanager** processes alerts and sends webhooks to Agent
4. **Agent** receives alerts via `/webhook/alerts` and triggers AI analysis
5. **AI Analysis** processes real alert context to determine appropriate actions

### Why This Is Much Better:
- âœ… **Industry Standard**: Real monitoring systems use this approach
- âœ… **Efficient**: No wasted resources on constant polling
- âœ… **Reactive**: Responds to actual problems, not scheduled checks
- âœ… **Scalable**: Can monitor hundreds of services without overhead
