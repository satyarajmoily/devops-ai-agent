## 🚀 **What's Working**

### **Core DevOps Capabilities**
1. **Infrastructure Monitoring**: Successfully monitors market-predictor service
2. **Automated Recovery**: Can restart services, analyze logs, and detect issues
3. **Alert Processing**: Handles Prometheus/Alertmanager webhooks
4. **Docker Management**: Full Docker API integration for container operations
5. **Health Validation**: Comprehensive service health checking
6. **DevOps Identity**: Clear positioning as infrastructure automation engineer

### **System Integration**
- **Market Predictor Integration**: Monitors and can recover the trading service
- **Monitoring Stack**: Integrated with Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Alertmanager
- **Container Management**: Docker socket access for infrastructure operations
- **LLM Analysis**: AI-powered log analysis and decision making

### **Safety & Reliability**
- **Bootstrap Paradox Prevention**: Won't restart itself to avoid infinite loops
- **External Monitoring**: Self-alerts routed to external monitoring
- **Graceful Error Handling**: Comprehensive error recovery and reporting
- **Timeout Management**: Proper timeout handling for all operations

## 🐛 **Known Issues & Limitations**

### **Current Limitations**
1. **Manual Deployment**: Still requires manual deployment processes
2. **Limited Scaling**: No automatic scaling capabilities yet
3. **Basic Metrics**: Limited custom metrics collection
4. **Single Target**: Currently focused only on market-predictor service

### **Technical Debt**
1. **Test Coverage**: Need comprehensive integration tests
2. **Documentation**: API documentation could be more detailed
3. **Configuration**: More flexible configuration management needed
4. **Monitoring**: Enhanced monitoring for the agent itself
