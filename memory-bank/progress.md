# DevOps AI Agent - Progress Status

## Project Status: AI COMMAND GATEWAY INTEGRATION

**Current Phase**: AI Command Gateway Integration - 🎉 ALL PHASES COMPLETE 🎉
**Progress**: Complete transformation from Docker SDK to AI Command Gateway architecture
**Status**: Production-ready AI orchestrator with centralized command management ✅

## Major Achievements ✅

### 🎯 Configuration Management Revolution (COMPLETED)
**Achievement**: Solved the dual-configuration issue that prevented proper LLM configuration
