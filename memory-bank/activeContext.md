- [ ] Continuous monitoring loop for market-predictor
- [ ] Issue detection for basic problems (service down, high latency)
- [ ] Simple LangChain agent for basic analysis
- [ ] Basic restart mechanism for predictor service
- [ ] Alert logging and response system

### Phase 1.4: Agent Infrastructure Testing (1-2 days)
**Focus**: Comprehensive testing and validation

- [ ] Integration tests for predictor communication
- [ ] End-to-end test for basic feedback loop
- [ ] Docker deployment testing
- [ ] Agent health monitoring validation

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Recent Technical Decisions:
1. **LangChain Framework**: Chosen for AI agent orchestration and LLM integration
2. **FastAPI + Agent Core**: Separate web service from autonomous agent logic
3. **Multi-Source Monitoring**: Prometheus, Loki, and direct HTTP monitoring
4. **Safety-First Approach**: All changes must pass testing before deployment
5. **OpenAI GPT-4**: Primary LLM for analysis and code generation

### Current Questions/Unknowns:
- **LLM Cost Management**: How to balance capability with API cost constraints?
- **Agent Memory**: What context should the agent maintain between cycles?
- **Error Recovery**: How should the agent handle LLM API failures?
- **Human Oversight**: What level of human control should be maintained?

### Pending Decisions:
- **LLM Model Selection**: GPT-4 vs. Claude for different tasks
- **Monitoring Frequency**: How often should the agent check predictor health?
- **Action Validation**: What testing is required before taking actions?
- **Learning Strategy**: How should the agent learn from past decisions?

## Integration Context

### Relationship with Market Predictor:
- **Monitoring Target**: Agent continuously monitors predictor service
- **Improvement Driver**: Agent identifies and implements improvements
- **Communication Pattern**: HTTP-based monitoring and metrics scraping
- **Safety Relationship**: Agent must never harm the predictor service

### Expected Integration Points:
1. **Health Monitoring**: Regular checks of `/health` and `/status` endpoints
2. **Metrics Analysis**: Scraping and analyzing Prometheus metrics
3. **Log Analysis**: Analyzing structured JSON logs for patterns
4. **Performance Tracking**: Monitoring response times and error rates
5. **Issue Response**: Automatic response to detected problems

## Development Environment Status

### Current Setup:
- [x] Project repository structure created
- [x] Empty memory-bank directory initialized
- [ ] Python virtual environment (to be created)
- [ ] LangChain and AI dependencies (to be installed)
- [ ] OpenAI API key configuration (to be set up)
- [ ] Docker environment (to be configured)

### Development Workflow:
1. **Phase Implementation**: Focus on one phase at a time
2. **AI-First Design**: Design around LangChain agent patterns
3. **Safety Testing**: Test all LLM interactions thoroughly
4. **Predictor Integration**: Keep market-predictor requirements central

## Risk Factors & Mitigation

### Identified Risks:
1. **LLM API Failures**: OpenAI/Anthropic API downtime or rate limiting
   - **Mitigation**: Implement fallback providers and graceful degradation
2. **AI Safety**: LLM generating harmful or incorrect actions
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive validation and human oversight
3. **Cost Overruns**: High LLM API usage costs
   - **Mitigation**: Usage monitoring, caching, and cost limits
4. **Complexity**: Over-engineering the autonomous agent
   - **Mitigation**: Start simple, iterate based on real needs

### Safety Considerations:
- **Testing First**: All AI-generated actions must pass local testing
- **Human Oversight**: Clear escalation paths for complex decisions
- **Rollback Capability**: Ability to undo any changes made by agent
- **Limited Scope**: Start with safe, low-risk actions only

## AI/LLM Integration Context

### LangChain Agent Design:
- **Analysis Agent**: Use LLM to analyze monitoring data and identify issues
- **Code Generation Agent**: Generate fixes and improvements (future milestone)
- **Testing Agent**: Validate proposed changes (future milestone)
- **Learning Agent**: Learn from past decisions and outcomes (future milestone)

### Prompt Engineering Strategy:
- **Structured Prompts**: Use consistent prompt templates for reliability
- **Context Management**: Maintain relevant context without token overflow
- **Output Validation**: Parse and validate all LLM responses
- **Iterative Refinement**: Improve prompts based on real usage

### Expected LLM Interactions:
```
1. Monitor market-predictor health and metrics
2. Detect anomalies or issues
3. Send monitoring data to LLM for analysis
4. Receive structured analysis with recommendations
5. Validate recommendations for safety
6. Execute safe actions (like service restart)
7. Monitor outcome and learn from results
```
